For automating setup, see OCP-UPI-KVM This automation is intended for test/development purposes only and there is no formal support. For issues please open a GitHub issue Pre-requisites Git : Please refer to the following link for instructions on installing git for Linux and Mac. Terraform >= 0.13 : Please refer to the following link for instructions on installing terraform for Linux and Mac. For validating the version run terraform version command after install. Terraform Providers : Please ensure terraform providers are built and installed on Terraform Client Machine. You can follow the Build Terraform Providers guide. libvirt : Please ensure libvirt is installed and configured on the KVM host. You can follow the Libvirt Host setup guide. Image and VM requirements For information on how to configure the images required for the automation see Preparing Images for Power . Following are the recommended VM configs for OpenShift nodes that will be deployed with RHCOS image. - Bootstrap, Master - 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 120 GB Disk This config is suitable for majority of the scenarios - Worker - 4 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 120 GB Disk Increase worker vCPUs, RAM and Disk based on application requirements Following is the recommended VM config for the helper node that will be deployed with RHEL 8.0 (or later) image. - Helper node (bastion) - 2vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 200 GB Disk OCP Install Follow these quickstart steps to kickstart OCP installation on Power KVM using libvirt.

This assumes PowerVC is used as the IaaS layer for managing the PowerVM LPARs. If you are using standalone PowerVM please take a look at the following quickstart guide which uses the ansible playbook to setup helper node (bastion) for OCP deployment. This project also leverages the same ansible playbook internally for OCP deployment on PowerVM LPARs managed via PowerVC. Run this code from either Mac or Linux (Intel) system. For automating setup, see OCP-UPI-PowerVM This automation is intended for test/development purposes only and there is no formal support. For bugs/enhancement requests etc. please open a GitHub issue Pre-requisites You need to identify a remote client machine for running the automation. This could be your laptop or a VM. Operating Systems This code has been tested on the following x86-64 based Operating Systems: - Linux - Mac OSX (Darwin) Packages Install the below required packages on the client machine. Git : Please refer to the link for instructions on installing the latest Git. Terraform >= 0.13.0 : Please refer to the link for instructions on installing Terraform. For validating the version run terraform version command after install. Public internet connection for all the nodes to download the playbooks and images as part of the setup process. Image and LPAR requirements You'll need to create RedHat CoreOS (RHCOS) and RHEL 8.0 (or later) image in PowerVC. For RHCOS image creation, follow the steps mentioned in the following doc . Following are the recommended LPAR configs for OpenShift nodes that will be deployed with RHCOS image. - Bootstrap, Master - 2 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 120 GB Disk. PowerVM LPARs by default uses SMT=8. So with 2vCPUs, the number of logical CPUs as seen by the Operating System will be 16 ( 2 vCPUs x 8 SMT ) This config is suitable for majority of the scenarios - Worker - 2 vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 120 GB Disk Increase worker vCPUs, RAM and Disk based on application requirements Following is the recommended LPAR config for the helper node that will be deployed with RHEL 8.0 (or later) image. - Helper node (bastion) - 2vCPUs, 16GB RAM, 200 GB Disk OCP Install Follow these quickstart steps to kickstart OCP installation on PowerVM LPARs managed via PowerVC Contributing Please see the contributing doc for more details.
